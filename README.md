# Machine Learning with Python

This course began with a gentle introduction to Machine Learning and what it is, with topics like supervised vs unsupervised learning, linear & non-linear regression, simple regression and more.  

Then I dove into classification techniques using different classification algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and Logistic Regression. I also learned about the importance and different types of clustering such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. 

I worked with Python libraries like SciPy and scikit-learn and applied my knowledge through works. In the final project I demonstrated my skills by building, evaluating and comparing several Machine Learning models using different algorithms.
